## Project 
The **s_shut project** describes a very simple system in order to shut down Raspberry Pi safely. It consists of a Python 3.x script *s_shut.py*, a simple schematic and this description.  
This project is tested in Raspberry models 3, 3B, 4B, zero-wh under raspbian V10 and above.  
The python script uses the awesome [libgpio](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/about/) library 

## Background
A running Linux computer should not be powered off without a controlled shutdown by the operating system, because this can result in damaging the file system on the SD_Card. 
Controlled power down is especially critical to achieve in so called headless systems with no monitor and keyboard. Raspberry computers do not provide a reset or power down switch.
The presented solution allows initiating shutdown or a restart with a switch or an external signal. It also provides a hardware signal (e.g. LED) indicating the running operating system state.

## Functionality

 **Power up**  
After Linux boot, a selectable port (default BCM21) is driven high and LED goes ON

**Switch pressed > 2 seconds**  
Linux command *'shutdown -P now'* will be executed by the script **s_shut.py** . 
As soon as critical storage operations are completed, LED goes OFF.

**Switch double clicked**  
System shuts down and restarts.  
Linux command *'shutdown -r now'*  will be executed by the script **s_shut.py**.

**Switch pressed > 6 seconds** [optional]  
System shuts down and activates a selectable port until no more SD card access occur. This signal may be used in order to completely power down Raspberry by switching off  the external power supply .

**Restart after shut down**  
This is only achievable by external power off and on again.
(A much more convenient solution is using the "UPS-2" project, that will follow here in the first Quarter 2021)

## Project Components
- The python script **s_shut.py**
